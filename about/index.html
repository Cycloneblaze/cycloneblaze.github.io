			<h1>About Cycloneblaze</h1>
			
			<p>I'm just this guy, you know?</p>
			
			<h2>But who are you?</h2>
			
			<p>I'm a physics student, in my 20's.</p>
			
			<p>I'm from Ireland, now living somewhere in Europe (this site is also available at <a href="http://cycloneblaze.eu">cycloneblaze.eu</a>!).</p>
			
			<p>My pronouns are he/him - I quite like this as a way to indicate one's gender (or in lieu of doing so).</p>
			
			<h2>What do you do?</h2>
			
			<p>I do internet stuff. I have some (old) art on deviantART, and some programming on GitHub. I dip into other projects from time to time. For example, right now I'm building a website...</p>
			
			<h2>Where's the name come from?</h2>
			
			<p><a href="http://www.blokcity.com/wiki/9420_Cycloneblaze">This Mega Bloks dragon</a> that was sat on a shelf nearby while I was searching for a username in about 2006.</a></p>
			
			<p>It has no special significance beyond that, but it's usually available and I still think it's a pretty distinctive online handle, and I like to be consistent, so I keep using it.</p>
			
			<p>You may find me elsewhere under the names <span class="italic">2Cycloneblaze2</span> or <span class="italic">Cycloneblaze2</span> if the name I wanted wasn't available. Most notably, Twitter.</p>
			
			<p>Also, I like to riff on it by forming other "Cyclone-<span class="italic">noun</span>" words. Like this, the Cyclonesite.</p>
			
			<h2>What's that icon?</h2>
			
			<p>This thing <img class="middle" src="../images/TheBlueComet_tr.png" alt="A small pixellated icon of a blue comet"> is a comet. The Blue Comet, eponymously.</p>
			
			<p>It originated in a pattern that I made for on <span class="italic">Animal Crossing: Let's Go To The City</span> (no less) and I've adopted it as my symbol.</p>
			
			<p>I like space and comets, and the colour blue, and pixel art, so I feel like it's pretty fitting. And it was too hard to create a visual representation of "a cycloneblaze".</p>
			
			<h2>I want to know more</h2>
			
			<p>You'll have to make friends with me and ask :)</p>
