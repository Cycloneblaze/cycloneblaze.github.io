			<p>Why "satellites"? It's fun, and kind of appropriate - these are the things on my website which sort of orbit around the edges. They aren't big enough to have their own pages. I don't have any real satellites up in space - yet!</p>

			<p>Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth...</p>

			<p>Deciding that the only kind of person who would be able to tell her about a land or a kingdom that suited her needs would be someone who had actually <em>been</em> there, Ruby had taken to wandering the spaceports and tourist traps and bars of the cosmos. Mainly it was in places like Magikos on Moribund, and around the Central District in Capital City, and, yes, even the Imperial City on Quintus. The problem was, there was many travellers, with the vast majority from many of the same places. It was a bit disheartening to hear from a person who'd lived in Yellow Sector all their lives and had made their first trip to Capitus, or a witch come to Moribund from Span when she discovered her magical aptitude, for the umpteenth time. It turned out that there was only so many places connected enough to the wider cosmos that they would visit anywhere else, and those places of course already had big and stable governments.<br><br>
			It was possible to tell, though, after a few weeks of talking to people, who was far-travelled and who was a mere tourist. Who had seen more than the places that anybody could visit, and who had never seen those places before, coming from so far away. Who had a <em>story</em>.</p>
