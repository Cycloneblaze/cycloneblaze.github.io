## Testing

Clone (or download) the repository and run `test-server.bat`. Then head to localhost:8000 in ya browser.

On Linux, there's `test-server.sh` instead.

You need to have Python 3 installed (and a graphical web browser, I guess). All styling should work on both Firefox and Chrome.

If for some reason you can't install Python 3 but you do have 2, run
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
instead.
